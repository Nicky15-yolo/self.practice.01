Heyyy..
this is a writing about my  practice to learn more about github  and the git itself.
i hope that i'll become  better and always have the will to study more about programming.


it's so sad that i always feel that i'm far left behind from my friends.
bu no matter, i'll find a way somehow. but prolly, it'll be longer than i thought it would be.
